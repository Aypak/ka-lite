__________________

You can remove KA Lite (when installed from pip or source distribution) with
``pip uninstall ka-lite`` or ``pip uninstall ka-lite-static`` (static version).


Removing user data
__________________

Some data (like videos and language packs) are downloaded into a location that
depends on the user running the KA Lite server. Removing that directory can
potentially reclaim lots of hard drive space.

On Windows, the HOME and USERPROFILE registry values will be used if set,
otherwise the combination ``%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%`` will be used.
You can check these values from the command prompt using the commands
``echo %HOME%``, ``echo $USERPROFILE%``, etc.
Within that directory, the data is stored in the ``.kalite`` subdirectory.
On most versions of Windows, this is ``C:\Users\YourUsername\.kalite\``.

On Linux, OSX, and other Unix-like systems, downloaded videos and database
files are in ``~/.kalite``.
